/**
 * Reverse engineered function from official drivers. Used to set device states
 * and modes. scmd() is the short form for system command.
 *
 * @param command there are currently three commands, we have identified. A
 *  value of 1 stands for IDLE command. A value of 4 means INIT and is used for
 *  loading firmwares onto the device. A value of 5 means STATE_CHANGE and is
 *  used to control the device's encoding procedure.
 * @param mode there is only one use case known so far. It's for setting
 *  encoding mode.
 * @param data applies to send[4] and send[5]. The 16-bit integer data needs to
 *  be split up into two 8-bit integers. It holds data to further specify
 *  the command parameter. In conjunction with STATE_CHANGE, it is used to set
 *  specific encoding states: 1 means STOP, 2 means START and 4 means NULL.
 *  Setting STATE_CHANGE to NULL will make the device output an empty data
 *  stream during the encoding process.

 *  right operation of 8. It's used for readibility. Minimum value is 0 and
 *  maximum is 16.
 * @param range applies to send[4] and send[5]. Sets n bits to 1, starting from
 *  the first bit in send[5]. If it's greater than 8, bits are set in send[4].
 *  Minimum value is 0 and maximum is 16.
